sw_eclipse_ii,SHIP,"Eclipse II was the second Eclipse-class dreadnought. It was also the second flagship of Palpatine. The Eclipse II resembled its predecessor Eclipse, including its coloration. However, certain aspects like the engine arrays were redesigned. In addition, a tower was added above the superlaser.",,,
sw_eclipse_i,SHIP,"The Eclipse-class dreadnought, also known as the Eclipse-class Super Star Destroyer, was a class of Imperial Super Star Destroyer manufactured by Kuat Drive Yards and mainly used around six years after the Battle of Endor. Like the Sovereign-class, they were regarded as a new generation of Super Star Destroyer. The Eclipse-class vessels were among the largest dreadnought-scale ships/Super Star Destroyers ever to be fielded within Galactic history. Although technically dwarfed in length by both the Executor-class Star Dreadnought and the Vengeance-class dreadnought by 1.5 kilometers, the Eclipse-class nonetheless exceeded even the Executor-class in terms of overall mass and volume. Its size was large enough for it to be classified as a space station. The most deadly weapon carried by Eclipse-class ships was an axial superlaser, similar to but significantly less powerful than one of the component beams used in the Death Star's superlaser. An Eclipse's superlaser easily had the power to destroy other Super Star Destroyers, as the Annihilator SSD found out when Tyber Zann seized the Eclipse's incredible power above Kuat. The class benefited from the most significant weaponry-improvements of the last few decades. This included gravity well projectors and improved ion cannons. In addition, the crime lord Tyber Zann wanted to access records on the ship, and if possible steal the ship, so he attacked Kuat and took control of the ship, and used it to damage an Imperial and rebel fleet (with his manipulating the latter group into granting him access). Afterwards, Zann had no further use for the vessel, finding its size to be more cumbersome for laying low to even the Rebel Alliance, and left it adrift, until the New Republic attacked and destroyed the Eclipse.",,,
sw_terror,SHIP,"The Terror was an Executor-class Star Dreadnought in service to the Galactic Empire during the Galactic Civil War. Under the command of Admiral Sarn, the Terror was assigned to protect the development of a new cloaking device for use with the TIE Phantom starfighter and was itself fitted with one of the devices powered by stygium crystals, allowing it to become invisible to both sensors and the naked eye. As the cloaking device was deactivated, the Terror would become visible from bow to stern, with the whole process completing in under ten seconds. The Terror was equipped to act as a carrier for the Empire's fleet of TIE Phantoms. A series of adjoining service hangars, separated by blast doors, contained hundreds of the cloaking device-equipped starfighters mounted on racks along the walls. Additional hangars were located on both sides of the ship to allow access for shuttles and other vessels. In addition to the TIE Phantoms stationed aboard the Terror, at least one of these hangars had facilities to store a number of TIE interceptors mounted from its ceiling.",,,
sw_knight_hammer,SHIP,"The Knight Hammer, originally named the Night Hammer, was a black Executor-class Star Dreadnought constructed in secret by Superior General Sander Delvardus and appropriated by Admiral Natasi Daala after Delvardus's death at her hands. Covered in stealth armor and hosting automated systems that allowed it to run with a fraction of the standard crew size, the Knight Hammer was particularly advanced for ships of its class. Plated with heavy black stealth armor, the vessel was invisible to enemy forces both sensor wise as well as visually at all but the closest ranges. It could hold enough forces to serve as an occupation force on a conquered world. Thousands of TIE/LN starfighters and TIE/sa bombers filled its launching bays, with certain bays in the aft of the ship, directly beside the massive engine systems, dedicated to bomber squadrons. Hundreds of escape pods were available in case an evacuation was required. The Knight Hammer featured an extravagant ready room, approximately the size of the command deck of a Victory-class Star Destroyer, in which the commander of the vessel could privately strategize. It came with its own sleeping quarters, was equipped with food processing stations, and had access to escape pods for the ship's command-level staff. A viewing window looked out onto the stars.",,,
sw_executor,SHIP,"The Executor-class Star Dreadnought, colloquially known as the Executor-class Super Star Destroyer was a heavy warship class in the Star Dreadnought league, often used as command ships and flagships in the Imperial Navy. At their prime, they were among the largest vessels in the galaxy, and were almost invincible in combat, although they were costly to operate. The Executor-class had over 5,000 weapons emplacements, including turbolasers, assault concussion missile launchers, and ion cannons. With warships able to direct all power to their energy weapons, the Executor-class had at least 100 times more firepower than an Imperial-class destroyer. A majority of gun batteries and missile launchers were located in the central cityscape on the class's dorsal side, while some point-defense guns were located throughout the side trenches. A minimum of 144 starfighters were carried on board Executor-class vessels, but the massive hangars could hold thousands.",,,
sw_vengeance_dreadnought,SHIP,"The Vengeance-class dreadnought was a dreadnought-scale warship in the Imperial Navy. It was based on the standard Super Star Destroyer design, the Executor-class. As such, the ship class was approximately 19 kilometers long. In contrast with the Executor-class, the Vengeance-class's frame was supplied with a slender build, more narrow than standard Star Destroyers, almost sword-like in comparison to the usual dagger shape. The Vengeance was only shown defeating a small, probably unmanned CR90 corvette, but the ship class it belonged to had armaments similar to Star Dreadnoughts of the Executor-class.",,,
sw_assertor,SHIP,"The Assertor-class Star Dreadnought was 15 kilometers long and had a hull-shape similar to the Executor-class Star Dreadnought, being primarily shaped like an arrowhead. It was considered the second largest of the standard Star Dreadnought line (with only the Executor-class being larger), as well as the largest in the Imperial Navy in a family that included the Mandator- and Bellator-class ships.",,,
sw_bellator,SHIP,"The Bellator-class dreadnought was a warship in the Imperial Navy, as well as a divergent design in the Mandator-series of Star Dreadnought. The Bellator-class dreadnought was a design based on the Mandator- and Mandator II-classes. It diverged from its predecessors by being shorter and faster and the design was referred to in the Imperial Military as a ""fast dreadnought"".",,,
sw_praetor_mk2,SHIP,"The Praetor Mark II-class battlecruiser was a warship class that served in the Imperial Navy. It was a model in the Star Destroyer design family, marked by a characteristic wedge-shape. The Praetor Mark II was designed and produced early on in the reign of the Galactic Empire as a follow-up to the smaller Republic-era Praetor-class Star Battlecruiser. Few ships of this class were commissioned, as Imperial strategies didn't favor battlecruiser designs. Battlecruisers were regarded as less effective terror weapons than the more massive dreadnaughts. As a result of the Empire's focus, the Mark IIs, along with other battlecruiser designs, were primarily used by the Empire to defend key areas in the Core region. Some battlecruisers were also used for particularly dangerous missions on the fringes of Imperial space, although they rarely left their docks except in cases of large engagements.",,,
sw_allegiance,SHIP,"The Allegiance-class battlecruiser was a large warship in the Imperial Navy. The Allegiance-class battlecruiser was similar in appearance to both the Victory, Procursator and Imperial-class Star Destroyers, but was larger than all of them, reaching a length of 2,200 meters.",,,
sw_conqueror,SHIP,"The Conqueror was an Imperial-class Star Destroyer armed with a superlaser that was in operation during the Galactic Civil War. Conceived as a replacement for the Galactic Empire's planet-destroying superweapon, the Death Star, lost at the Battle of Yavin, the Conqueror was intended to slow the momentum of the rapidly growing Rebel Alliance. The superlaser component of the Star Destroyer was constructed at an Imperial research facility on Naboo under the supervision of the Imperial storm commandos. It was projected that the superlaser on the Conqueror, when properly installed, would give the Star Destroyer the ability to break apart a small moon, or crack a continent in half. The Conqueror was a 1,600-meter-long Imperial-class Star Destroyer. The starship had a spacious hangar bay that was large enough to hold several Lambda-class T-4a shuttles, a TIE Advanced x1 starfighter, and an Incom X4 Gunship.",,,
sw_tector,SHIP,"The Tector-class Star Destroyer was a Star Destroyer class in service with the Galactic Republic and the Galactic Empire. The Tector-class was first produced by Kuat Drive Yards during the Clone Wars. It, along with the Imperator-class, was one of the largest Republic warship classes fielded during the conflict. It was a 1.6-kilometer-long dagger-shaped vessel, essentially a version of the contemporary Imperial-class, with ventral hangars absent. Instead of ventral hangar bays, the design opted for an increase in armor that covered the areas normally used as main hangar openings, as well as the reactor core.",,,
sw_imperial_ii,SHIP,"The Imperial II-class Star Destroyer, also known as an Impstar-Deuce, was a Star Destroyer model manufactured by Kuat Drive Yards for use by the Imperial Navy. Several differences existed between the Imperial I and Imperial II-class Star Destroyer, including the replacement of the tractor beam targeting array between the command tower's sensor globes with a communications tower, as well as the removal of point defense weaponry. The Imperial II was built with a heavily reinforced hull, stronger deflector shields, and greater firepower than the original Imperial I class. The prominent quad heavy turbolaser and heavy ion cannon turrets flanking the surface of the Imperial I-class Star Destroyer were also replaced with batteries of eight-barreled turbolasers or ions in unarmored barbette mountings.",,,
sw_imperial_i,SHIP,"The Imperial I-class Star Destroyer, also known as the Imperial I-class Destroyer or the Imperator-class Star Destroyer,was an iconic class of warships designed by Lira Wessex and built by Kuat Drive Yards. The Imperial-class Star Destroyers, along with Imperial stormtroopers, represented the might of the Imperial Military throughout the galaxy during the reign of the Galactic Empire.",,,
sw_interdictor,SHIP,"The Interdictor-class Star Destroyer was a variant of the Imperial I-class Star Destroyer equipped with gravity well projectors.  To make room for the gravity well projectors, half of the turbolasers and ion cannons, as well as eight of the Phylon Q7 tractor beam projectors found on the original Imperial-class Star Destroyer, had to be removed.",,,
sw_procursator,SHIP,"The Procursator-class Star Destroyer was an Imperial warship in the Star Destroyer design family. The Procursator-class was similar in appearance to the Imperial-class Star Destroyer. It was slightly shorter, at 1200 meters in length.",,,
sw_onager,SHIP,"The Onager-class Star Destroyer, nicknamed the Imperial Siege Breaker by members of the Rebel Alliance, was a type of rare capital ship and superweapon deployed by the Galactic Empire that was shrouded in secrecy. Initially developed to swiftly eradicate Separatist holdouts that remained after the Clone Wars and to bring Core Worlds under the control of the Empire, the Onager-class saw service throughout the Imperial Era. Following the deployment of the Death Star, the Onager was considered to be a possibly greater threat than the battle station. A notable characteristic of the Onager was its alleged kyber-crystal¡Vpowered superweapons, which could either be Superheavy Composite Beam Turbolasers or Orbital Bombardment Particle Cannons. These weapons were powerful enough to engage capital ships from extremely long range, as well as conduct cataclysmic assaults on planets. The Onager was utilized as an orbital bombardment platform that was usually deployed at long range and designed to fatally end the deadlock of strong planetary shields. When conducting these strikes, it targeted the shields' deflector shield generator and other surface defenses. The Star Destroyer was also deployed in anti-fleet actions and specific operations, while being defended by escort vessels and its starfighter complement.",,,
sw_cc_victory_ii,SHIP,"Like the normal Victory II-class Star Destroyer, the Crimson Command Victory II-class Star Destroyer is a heavy frigate for the Imperial Remnant. However, with double the number of Turbolasers and Ion Cannons, the Crimson Command Victory Star Destroyer is much more potent, rivaling the Imperial I-class Star Destroyer in firepower. As an added bonus, they are much faster and more maneuverable than an ISD.",,,
sw_victory_ii,SHIP,"The Victory II-class Star Destroyer was an improved version of the Victory I-class Star Destroyer. The Victory II-class was a more direct predecessor to the Imperial-class Star Destroyer. Though outwardly similar to the Victory I-class Star Destroyer, the Victory II-class was designed for deep space combat. With this in mind, the designers fitted the ships with Hoersch-Kessel Drive, Inc. engines in place of the Victory I's LF9 ion engines to overcome weaknesses of the earlier design. Besides its faster sublight speed, the most notable change was the addition of ion cannons, more turbolasers, tractor beam projectors, and the removal of the banks of concussion missile tubes.",,,
sw_victory_i,SHIP,"The Victory I-class Star Destroyer was a warship designed for planetary defense, planetary assault, ground troop support, and ship-to-ship combat. Victory I-class Star Destroyers were 900 meters long, just over half the size of the later Imperial-class Star Destroyer. Despite being several decades old at the time, the shields and hull armor of Victory I-class ships were still quite heavy compared to the other vessels used during the Galactic Civil War. They were equipped with 10 quad turbolaser batteries, 40 double turbolaser batteries, 80 concussion missiles tubes, and 10 tractor beam projectors. Ships of the class were clad in 9095-T8511 grade durasteel.",,,
sw_modular_taskforce_cruiser,SHIP,"The modular taskforce cruiser was a support vessel class built by Tagge Industries Shipyards Limited for the Galactic Empire. These ships functioned as a generic framework on which Mission Function Modules could be mounted and reconfigured as necessary. In its baseline configuration, the ship consisted of a command section, a life-support system, quarters for a skeleton crew, and an engineering section. Since this was a support vessel, armament was light for its size. On its own, the baseline configuration did little more than transport a small amount of cargo. The real purpose of this framework was to carry mission-specific modules. Mission Function Modules, also known as ""MFMs,"" were independent units which were attached to the skeleton of the modular taskforce cruiser. Inquisition module used mainly to punish rebellious planets, the inquisition module was outfitted with equipment for mass executions, destroying a planet's information infrastructure, reinforcing the Imperial Army presence on a world, or completely destroying the world's population if necessary. The survey module was designed for rapid planetary and system exploration operations. Assisted by its complement of airspeeders and droids, it was capable of completely analyzing a planet, including surveying for natural resources and good colony sites, within a standard day. It could also plot viable hyperlanes from the survey location to major trade routes. It cost one million credits and contained over 100 airspeeders, 5 Skipray blastboats, and 6 TIE/sa bombers for defense.",,,
sw_vindicator,SHIP,"The Vindicator-class heavy cruiser was the standard 600-meter-long heavy cruiser design of the Imperial Navy. It was intended for use in situations in which Imperial-class Star Destroyers were unavailable, and smaller ships were not powerful enough.",,,
sw_acclamator,SHIP,"The Acclamator-class assault ship was an assault-class capital ship created for the Galactic Republic by Rothana Heavy Engineering. It was the predecessor of the later Republic and Imperial models in the Star Destroyer line. The Acclamator-class assault transport was 752 meters long, 460 meters in width, and 200 meters in height. Its mission profile required it to both carry troops and engage enemy starships: the Acclamator was designed to assault contested systems, break hostile orbital blockades, and land troops directly on the battlefield. Consequently, the Acclamator favored a wedge or dagger shaped design due to its effectiveness¡Xit allowed concentration of firepower while minimizing target profile. This basic design was used in a number of larger craft pre-dating it and would define Imperial ships for decades to come.",,,
sw_immobilizer,SHIP,"The Immobilizer 418 cruiser was a 600-meter-long cruiser built on the standard Vindicator-class heavy cruiser hull. Equipped with gravity well projectors designed to pull ships from hyperspace and/or prevent them making the jump to lightspeed, the Interdictor became a valuable addition to the Imperial Navy.",,,
sw_dreadnought,SHIP,"The Dreadnaught-class heavy cruiser was a type of capital ship built for planetary occupation and space combat used by the Galactic Republic, Galactic Empire, New Republic, local governments, and various other organizations. The keel of the Dreadnaught-class ran nearly 600 meters with the bow overlapping to produce a clamshell-like appearance. Each vessel had a cluster of weapons blisters spread across the hull. The ship was designated a heavy cruiser in standard classification and was considered a downscaled warship when compared to the ship-designs from the Core.",,,
sw_broadside_cruiser,SHIP,"The Broadside-class was first produced by Kuat Drive Yards in the early days of the Galactic Civil War. It was conceived as a long-range missile ship, and was based on the Gladiator-class. The design was stripped of passenger compartments, the hangar bays were turned into torpedo bays and the vessel lost some of its armor. Due to the lack of self-sufficiency, the Broadside-class was redesignated as a ""cruiser"" instead of a ""Star Destroyer"". Kuat engineers also decided that great maneuverability was not necessary for the class, thus leaving the Broadside slower than the Gladiator. This was the cause of its vulnerability to other capital warships, and as a result ships of this class were in practice almost never deployed without an escort. However, its missiles proved lethal against fighter squadrons and small space stations. In addition to its design-problems, a number of Broadsides were stolen or otherwise acquired by the Zann Consortium during the Civil War.",,,
sw_lancer,SHIP,"The Lancer-class frigate was a capital ship used for anti-starfighter operations in the Imperial Navy. The Lancer-class was a frigate design armed with 20 AG-2G quad laser cannons, with at least some of these guns capable of being retracted into the main hull of the vessel.",,,
sw_secutor,SHIP,"The Secutor-class Star Destroyer was a carrier in the Imperial Navy and possibly the Republic Navy. The Secutor-class was 2.2 kilometers long and had two ventral hangar apertures, serving primarily as a carrier. Its length and volume would normally have put it in the battlecruiser-scale of the Anaxes War College System, specifically under Star Cruiser, and it was even given the alternate designation of Secutor-class battlecruiser because of this, but it was lightly armed for its size, and had extensive carrier-capability and was instead designated as a Star Destroyer. The carrier was one of the largest dedicated craft in the Navy.",,,
sw_gladiator,SHIP,"The Gladiator-class Star Destroyer was a class of Star Destroyer used by the Galactic Empire. It utilized a solar ionization reactor that was located on its ventral hull, and had a hangar at the bow with two prongs.",,,

sw_venator_imperial,SHIP,"The Venator-class Star Destroyer, also known as the Venator-class Destroyer, Republic attack cruiser, and later Imperial attack cruiser, was one of the capital ships used extensively by the Galactic Republic during the later parts of the Clone Wars, as well as by the Galactic Empire. It was designed and constructed by Kuat Drive Yards and Allanteen Six shipyards. The Venator-class was born from the success of the Acclamator-class assault ship and was designed by Lira Blissex for the purpose of serving as a medium-sized, versatile multi-role warship.",,,
sw_venator_republic,SHIP,"The Venator-class Star Destroyer, also known as the Venator-class Destroyer, Republic attack cruiser, and later Imperial attack cruiser, was one of the capital ships used extensively by the Galactic Republic during the later parts of the Clone Wars, as well as by the Galactic Empire. It was designed and constructed by Kuat Drive Yards and Allanteen Six shipyards. The Venator-class was born from the success of the Acclamator-class assault ship and was designed by Lira Blissex for the purpose of serving as a medium-sized, versatile multi-role warship.",,,
sw_proclamator,SHIP,"The Proclamator-class Star Frigate was built in the waning days of the Galactic Republic and had been originally designed as a warship cousin of the Acclamator-class assault ship. Unlike the Acclamator, it lacked the huge capacity for carrying troops and their supporting equipment and instead focused on anti-shipping firepower. Due to its short service life with the Galactic Republic, the Proclamator would continue to see service in the Imperial Navy alongside the Victory I and Victory II class ships, fulfilling a similar role to those ships. But whereas the Victory class was built more for anti-shipping work and was the ¡¥gun¡¦ to support the Venator¡¦s massed fighter wings, the Proclamator was designed to be flexible. Armed with six triple heavy turbolasers and six quad medium turbolasers the ship lacked the raw punch of the Victory class. But, due to the addition of 21 quad light and heavy blaster mountings for anti-fighter work the ship was far more dangerous for fighters to attack.",,,
sw_core_ship,SHIP,"The battlesphere was a variant of the Trade Federation Lucrehulk-class Core Ship, used by the Confederacy of Independent Systems during the Clone Wars. Unlike the Lucrehulk-class Core Ship, the battlesphere employed multiple reactors and was fitted with more extensive hyperwave transceivers. Its hangar facilities had enough room for several fighter squadrons. There was also a storage room for additional battle droid parts. Outlying control stations and sensors spanned out from the central sphere. The Confederacy of Independent Systems placed a battlesphere in the atmosphere on one of the moons of Ruusan. This Skytop Station served as an important listening post for the Separatists, enabling General Grievous to launch many successful campaigns by gaining knowledge about the Republic fleet positions through the station.",,,
sw_captor,SHIP,"The Captor-class heavy munitions cruiser, also known as the Trade Federation heavy munitions cruiser, was a type of commercial freighter-warship used by the Trade Federation to transport bacta to buyers throughout the galaxy around 44 BBY. They shared similar designs with the LH-3010 capital freighter and Lucrehulk-class LH-3210 freighters also used by the Federation, and were at least several hundred meters long. Although built as dedicated warships for the corporation's Trade Defense arm, they were much smaller and less powerful than the Lucrehulk-class, which the Trade Federation later converted into battleships for their attack on Naboo and used during the Clone Wars.",,,
sw_auxilia,SHIP,The Auxilia-class pursuit destroyer was a ship from Kuat Drive Yards that was used by the Trade Defense Forces. It is the sister ship of the Captor-class heavy munitions cruiser and is more heavily armed.,,,
sw_lucrehulk,SHIP,"The Lucrehulk-class battleship was the primary capital ship of the Trade Federation's Trade Defense Force. Most Lucrehulks were modified from enormous cargo haulers. Upgraded and modified versions were later used by the CIS Navy, the Separatist holdouts, the Alliance to Restore the Republic, the Corporate Sector Authority and the Killik Colony. During the Imperial Period, some militarized Lucrehulks remained in operation, fighting on the side of Separatist holdouts or early Rebel Alliance units. One of several Alliance Lucrehulks, the Fortressa served as a starfighter carrier, carrying a complement of hundreds of T-65 X-wing starfighters. In 0 BBY, it participated in an assault on the first Death Star and was destroyed by the battle station's superlaser.",,,
sw_mc_heavy,SHIP,"The Mon Calamari heavy carrier was a warship developed by the Mon Calamari for use by the Galactic Alliance Defense Force. One warship of the class, Blue Diver, was attached to the Galactic Alliance Second Fleet. It was part of a task force of Second Fleet warships dispatched to Corellia in 40 ABY during a growing crisis between the Alliance and the Corellian government. It carried several fighter squadrons and was equipped with turbolasers and ion cannons.",,,
sw_mc75,SHIP,"The MC75 Star Cruiser was a model of Star Cruiser in the service of the Alliance Fleet. The city-ship's former civic atrium was hollowed out and converted into a docking bay and starship service area, overseen by a hangar traffic control suite protected by overlapping shields and magnetic containment fields to keep oxygen and pressure regulated. The docking bay and service area was capable of accommodating ships up to corvette size.",,,
sw_endurance,SHIP,"The Endurance-class fleet carrier served as the centerpiece of modern New Republic fleets composed of New Class warships. The Endurance had a Class 1 hyperdrive and could carry 1,600 troops and enough consumables for five months. However, weapons had to be sacrificed to make room for extra fighters. Endurance-class fleet carriers were only armed with a secondary armament of twelve turbolaser cannons, twenty laser cannons, eight ion cannons, and four tractor beam projectors. While they boasted improved hull integrity, their shields were markedly less powerful. Although they were equipped with a formidable anti-starfighter weapon system, the fleet carriers were usually protected by screening ships and starfighters. They were not designed to enter the savage heart of battle, but to deploy and coordinate smaller ships. The main fighting punch of an Endurance-class ship consisted of almost four wings of starfighters. One wing was a short-range assault wing composed of K-wing bombers and Defender starfighters for close support. Another wing was a long-range superiority wing composed of hyperdrive-equipped fighters such as E-wings, A-wings, and X-wings.",,,
sw_liberator,SHIP,"The Liberator-class cruiser was a powerful frontline capital ship designed by the SoroSuub Corporation to combat piracy.

sw_ton_falk,SHIP,"The Ton-Falk-class escort carrier was a transport ship designed to carry Imperial starfighters. Designed and built by Kuat Drive Yards, the Ton-Falk-class escort carrier allowed the Imperial Navy to overcome the hyperdrive deficiency of its primary starfighters in the early years of the Galactic Civil War.",,,
sw_imperial_escort_carrier,SHIP,"The Imperial escort carrier was a type of capital ship used exclusively by the Galactic Empire's storm commandos. Like normal carriers, it was capable of deploying TIE starfighters into battle, including the advanced TIE Hunter, and it had a large hangar opening on each side of the hull, but it was also capable of engaging in combat on its own account. Ships of this type were used to attack medium-sized craft and transports of the Rebel Alliance, boarding and seizing the Rebel starships and their crew. As the storm commandos were regarded as elite infantry, these ships were capable of deploying troops for planetary assault.",,,
sw_quasar,SHIP,"The Quasar Fire-class cruiser-carrier was a starship line built by the SoroSuub Corporation. It saw service in the Galactic Empire's Imperial Navy, both as a starfighter carrier and a mobile base of operations. In the year 3 BBY, the Spectres, alongside Cham Syndulla of the Free Ryloth Movement, stole a Quasar Fire-class cruiser-carrier in orbit of Ryloth for the rebellion. The stolen ship became the flagship of Phoenix Cell of the early rebellion, rechristened the Phoenix Nest, housing their RZ-1 A-wing interceptors, and even being repainted to show its new affiliation. After coming under attack by Imperial forces, the starship fled with the rest of the rebel fleet to the planet Atollon. After the formation of the Alliance to Restore the Republic, it became part of the Alliance Fleet, with Colonel Anj Zavor recommending to Mon Mothma the procurement of more escort carriers from the Empire.",,,
sw_arquitens,SHIP,"The Arquitens-class light cruiser,  later the Imperial light cruiser, was a line of light cruisers designed by Kuat Drive Yards that saw extensive service with the Republic Navy during the Clone Wars. The Arquitens-class resembled a smaller version of the Venator-class Star Destroyer, with engines similar to the smaller Consular-class space cruiser. Atop the main hull was a small T-shaped command tower, with two quad laser turrets flanking it. Two identical emplacements were located on the ventral bow, while four dual-barreled turbolaser batteries were located on the sides of the cruiser. Large slits on either side of these cannons allowed them to be repositioned for frontal, broadside or backwards firing. This function, combined with the dorsal & ventral turrets, granted the ship a good arc of fire.",,,
sw_vigil,SHIP,"The Vigil-class corvette was a warship in the Imperial Navy. Produced by Kuat Drive Yards for the Imperial Navy, the Vigil class was considered the smallest vessel in the iconic Star Destroyer line of ships. Thanks to their size and role, these ships rarely served in the line of battle with larger types of star destroyers. Instead they patrolled trade routes, escorted cruisers as picket ships, served as battlegroup leaders for small backwater fleets, operated as lone cruisers hunting pirates and smugglers, and generally served where a larger destroyer was deemed excessive or wasteful.",,,
sw_tartan,SHIP,"The Tartan-class patrol cruiser was an Imperial anti-starfighter ship developed by Damorian Manufacturing Corporation towards the start of the New Order. Armed with twenty laser cannons, the Tartan-class cruisers were designed for use against starfighters, bombers, and pirate vessels.",,,

sw_viscount,SHIP,"The Viscount-class Star Defender was a very large warship series developed by the Mon Calamari for use by the New Republic Defense Fleet. The Viscount-class Star Defender was envisioned as the New Republic equivalent of an Executor-class Star Dreadnought. The first prototype was a 3 km long battlecruiser, and the full production model was a 17 km long dreadnought. Although slightly shorter in length than the Executor-class, the superior engineering skills of the Mon Calamari enabled the vessel to carry more starfighters.",,,
sw_lusankya,SHIP,"The Lusankya, originally known as Executor II, was an Executor-class Star Dreadnought built by Kuat Drive Yards, as the sister ship to the Executor, which was built at Fondor. Following its construction, the ship was buried beneath the surface of Coruscant as an emergency evacuation craft for the Emperor, where it served as Ysanne Isard's private prison after his gifting it to her as a loyal supporter, and later as her command ship during the Bacta War. When Isard was defeated, the Lusankya was acquired by the New Republic. It served in the New Republic fleet until its destruction in the Yuuzhan Vong War. The Lusankya was designed to be a variant of the Executor-class, focusing more on planetary occupation without a need for supporting vessels. As such, it dispensed with some heavy turbolaser batteries in exchange for more point-defense weaponry. ",,,
sw_mc85,SHIP,"The MC85 Star Cruiser was a heavy Star Cruiser manufactured by the Mon Calamari Shipyards and the Corellian Engineering Corporation after the Galactic Civil War. The MC85 Star Cruiser was a class of Heavy Star Cruiser that measured at a length of 3,438.37 meters. Jointly constructed by the Mon Calamari Shipyards and Corellian Engineering Corporation for service in the New Republic Defense Fleet, the MC85's interior was designed to be more amenable to non-amphibious crew members, though it still had special waterways for aquatic species. Due to the New Republic's limited personnel, the MC85 was designed to be a highly automated ship, able to operate at full capacity with only skeleton crews. Despite its large size, the MC85 was a fast cruiser. Even nearly thirty years after commission, the Dawn of Tranquility, in service with the Resistance under the name Raddus, was still able to outrun the First Order's modern battlecruisers and the massive Supremacy. Propelled by eleven sublight ion engines of different sizes, these massive ships were as fuel hungry as they were fast. As part of the New Republic's Military Disarmament Act, the MC85 was designed to put a greater emphasis on its defensive shields than its offensive firepower. Hence, while undergunned for a typical ship of its size, featuring only a few dozen heavy turbolasers, heavy ion cannons, and point-defense laser cannon turrets in total as well as half a dozen proton torpedo launchers, the MC85 compensated for this with highly durable advanced deflector shields. These experimental shields that cocooned the ship were capable of repelling huge amounts of damage before failing, far more than most other ships.",,,

Unlike most combat ships, which devoted 25% of their power to shields, the shields of a Gamma-class assault shuttle took up a full 62% of its power, with over half of that directed to the ship's front arc. This allowed assault shuttles to withstand heavy damage as they pulled up near hostile ships.",,,
sw_xg1_starwing,SHIP,"The Alpha-class Xg-1 Star Wing was a starship model utilized by the Alliance to Restore the Republic during the Galactic Civil War. The 10-meter-long Xg-1 was based on a tri-wing design similar to the Lambda-class shuttle, another craft that Cygnus Spaceworks designed.",,,
sw_mg100,SHIP,"The MG-100 StarFortress SF-17, also known as the B/SF-17 heavy bomber, was a model of heavy bomber manufactured by Slayn & Korpil for use by the New Republic during the late stages of the Galactic Civil War. The starship featured six sublight ion thrusters, a single hyperdrive, and artificial gravity projectors. At the bottom-front of the ship strutted a targeting sensor mast, which contained a targeting sensor and active-tracking array. Two short range comms antenna were located along the top of the ship along its keel line. Jutting horizontally from the ship's profile were two stabilizer foils. In total, the ship was crewed by five individuals. A single pilot and flight engineer operated within the armored cockpit. The bombardier operated a targeting pedestal on the flight deck, and two gunners operated the rear and ventral ball turrets. The B/SF-17's intended purpose was to deliver a payload of 1,048 proton bombs on top of a target. The modular bombing magazine, called the ""clip"" by the bomber's crew, would drop the bombs through sequenced electromagnetic plates in the clip, which propelled the bombs to ""drop"" in microgravity environments. The bombs would then be drawn magnetically to their targets.",,,

The engines could reach speeds up to 1,300 KPH and 120 MGLT.",,,
sw_defender,SHIP,"The Defender starfighter, or Republic Systems Defender, was a starfighter developed by the Republic Engineering Corporation as part of the Defender design program. It was based on the ATL Interceptor used by the Fromm Gang 15 BBY. The Defender was 5.3 meters long and armed with three laser cannons: one in the nose of the craft, and one each on either side beneath the wing. To save space and weight, the standard Defender starfighter was not equipped with a hyperdrive. Its extendible S-foil maneuvering struts could retract into the spaceframe for non-combat situations, but once an enemy had been engaged, the struts swung down and forward to give the Defender better positioning for maneuvering-jet bursts. While sudden maneuvers in an atmosphere actually risked tearing off the struts (due to the G-forces, the gravity of the planet itself, and atmospheric drag), in space, the Defender could literally spin around 180 degrees in mid-flight by firing one maneuvering jet forward and one backward.",,,
sw_kwing,SHIP,"The BTL-S8 K-wing assault starfighter was a heavy starfighter/bomber. The K-wing assault starfighter was produced by Koensayr Manufacturing, the same company responsible for producing the venerable Y-wing.

sw_t70_xwing,SHIP,"The T-70 X-wing starfighter was the successor to the T-65B X-wing starfighter, manufactured by Incom-FreiTek for use by the New Republic Defense Fleet. Faster and more expensive and complex than the former T-65B, the T-70 featured advanced weaponry and proved more versatile than its predecessor, and was essential in both dogfights and capital-ship scale combat operations. Appropriated S-foils designs allowed a greater range of fire, while four KX12 laser cannons offered single, dual, and quad firing modes. A built in dual proton torpedo launcher with quick-change magazines permitted the utilization of alternative armaments.",,,
sw_ewing,SHIP,"The E-7 E-wing multi-role starfighter was a single-pilot starfighter developed by FreiTek Inc. It was notable for being the first fighter designed entirely under the support of the New Republic. As designed, the E-wing was intended to match or exceed the performance of the preceding X-wing series in every respect, and was meant to replace the older design in New Republic service.",,,
sw_bwing,SHIP,"The A/SF-01 B-wing starfighter was a heavily armed Rebel Alliance single-pilot starfighter and bomber manufactured by Slayn & Korpil. It was primarily designed as a ""blockade buster"" to attack and destroy large capital ships. As such, it was equipped with weaponry and systems normally reserved for much larger craft.",,,
sw_hwing,SHIP,"The BTS-A2 Long-Range Strike Fighter/Bomber (Rebel Alliance designation H-Wing) was an addition to Rebel fighter wings manufactured by Koensayr Manufacturing, a company made famous for their rugged Y-Wing starfighters. The H-Wing was a stable weapons platform capable of delivering a rather hard-hitting punch; only the B-Wing was more heavily armed. The fighter's primary long-range weapon was its medium laser cannon which was mounted in a fully rotating dorsal turret. The weapon could only be fired from the turret's gunnery chair. As with the Y-Wing, the H-Wing carried two Arakyd Industries proton torpedo launchers. As well as these primary weapons, the fighter also had two light ion cannons which were fire linked for greater effect and were mounted in the starboard nose of the fighters' twin-nose hull. The H-Wing was designed to survive extended combat engagements and multiple hits by using a new heavily reinforced armored hull, with the added protection provided by strong, high-energy shields. However, weapons capability and hull integrity did both come at a great cost; both maneuverability and sublight speed had been sacrificed for increased battle worthiness, creating a distinct disadvantage in the H-Wing that has an extremely small chance of outrunning a numerically superior enemy or of disengaging prior to retreating.",,,
sw_twing,SHIP,"The R-60 T-wing interceptor was an interceptor originally designed to replace the A-wing. Unfortunately for the Rebellion, the end result turned out to be a poor replacement for the craft. Like the A-wing, the T-wing was a light fast-response starfighter. The ship's speed was similar to a TIE Interceptor, but it also included hyperdrive capability. With shield and hull strength similar to that of the Z-95 Headhunter, this craft would not last long if it was hit accurately by even a medium-power salvo.",,,

Unlike the BTL-S3 Y-wing and its successor designs, the BTL-B model had a full covering of both the primary fuselage and engines. A bubble-turret provided clear view for the gunner. The BTL-B was designed as a bomber, using such weapons as proton bombs. The bubble-turret utilized two light ion cannons for defense against enemy starfighters. It also was equipped with two medium laser cannons mounted on the front of the starfighter.",,,
sw_delta7,SHIP,"The Delta-7 Aethersprite-class light interceptor, more commonly known as the Delta-7 Aethersprite light interceptor or Jedi starfighter due to its extensive use by Jedi, was an interceptor commissioned just before the outbreak of the Clone Wars in 22 BBY. The starfighter was considered highly advanced at the time of its creation and carried sophisticated equipment, but it was expensive to produce. The ship was armed with two twin laser cannons (later models modified by Jedi Master Saesee Tiin would contain four quad-pulse laser cannons hidden behind breakaway panels, in addition to its usual complement of two twin laser cannons), and an advanced communication and sensor array kept the pilot of the ship well-prepared in firefights as well as peacetime.",,,
sw_arc170,SHIP,"The Aggressive ReConnaissance-170 starfighter, also known as the ARC-170 starfighter and Advanced Recon fighter, was a heavy starfighter that saw widespread use by the Republic Navy throughout the Clone Wars. Designed and manufactured by the Incom Corporation, the ARC-170 was an ancestor of the T-65 X-wing starfighter, which would be mainly used by the Alliance to Restore the Republic. The ARC-170 was jointly produced by Incom and Subpro Corporation. Like their other starfighter designs of its time, such as the lighter Z-95, and the heavier PTB-625, and NTB-630, the ARC-170 had a narrow spaceframe flanked by large engines. The ARC-170 also possessed an S-foil system, which helped to radiate heat, something that aided the fighter's shielding. This also provided additional stability during atmospheric flight.",,,

V-wings were some of the more recent spacecraft in the Republic Navy, and frequently filled the role as combat support ships. The small silhouette, high speed, and great agility of this fighter made it hard to target and a very effective ship despite its small size.",,,
sw_eta2,SHIP,"The Eta-2 Actis-class interceptor, also known as the Jedi interceptor or Jedi starfighter due to its extensive use by Jedi pilots, was a Republic starfighter used late in the Clone Wars that shared design elements with the Republic's Delta-7 and Delta-7B starfighters, as well as the TIE fighters of the later Galactic Empire. The Galactic Alliance would later come to utilize a successor, the Eta-5 interceptor. At 5.47 meters in length, the Eta-2 was significantly shorter than the already diminutive Delta-7. The new fighter's mass was further reduced by removing much of the forward space-frame, leaving the front of the ship in a forked shape. Like its predecessor, it was also too small to hold an onboard hyperdrive. Because of this, the Eta-2 had to rely on carrier vessels or Syliure-45 hyperdrive modules for long-distance travel. However, the Actis did have a full astromech droid socket, instead of a truncated unit as was seen in the early models of Aethersprite starfighters.",,,
sw_ntb_630,SHIP,"The NTB-630 naval bomber was jointly produced by the Incom and Subpro Corporations during the Clone Wars. The NTB-630 was more heavily armed and armored than its close cousin, the ARC-170 starfighter, and the similar PTB-625 planetary bomber. With a narrow spaceframe flanked by at least two large engines, the NTB-630 resembled other Incom/Subpro starfighters such as the Z-95 Headhunter, the PTB-625, and the ARC-170. The NTB-630 was created to deliver its payloads while engaged in space battles, and was therefore also more maneuverable than the PTB-625, allowing it to get close to capital ships and avoid their turbolasers as it executed bombing runs.",,,
sw_laat,SHIP,"The Low Altitude Assault Transport/infantry (LAAT/i), often referred to as the Republic attack gunship or Republic Gunship, was a specialized gunship designed for aerial-based support and infantry transportation. It was produced by Rothana Heavy Engineering and used by the Grand Army of the Republic during the Clone Wars. The Galactic Empire also used it for a brief period after the conclusion of the war.

sw_n1,SHIP,"The Naboo Royal N-1 starfighter, sometimes known simply as the Naboo starfighter, was a starfighter used by the government of Naboo during the late years of the Galactic Republic and early days of the Galactic Empire for defense, patrol, and escort duties. The Royal N-1 starfighter featured the best elements of Naboo design, being aesthetically sound and adhering to the Naboo's love for curves and aerodynamic shapes. The citizens of Naboo were dedicated to the defense of their ecologically sensitive world, and the N-1 was an example of this commitment. Its specialized engine system, twin J-type Nubian 221 sub-light pulse engines, ensured that fuel would burn hotter in order to reduce harmful emissions. The N-1's weapons were twin laser cannons and a full complement of 10 proton torpedoes. These were powerful enough to allow the N-1 to engage even the superior numbers of Vulture droids of the Trade Federation Droid Control Ship as was required during the Battle of Naboo.",,,
sw_nb1s,SHIP,"The Naboo NB-1S Royal Bomber, or Naboo bomber, was a prototype vehicle rarely used by the Royal Naboo Security Forces. It combined deadly Nubian technology with Naboo spaceframe design. It was the successor of the NB-1 Royal Bomber. Like the N-1 starfighter, the NB-1S Royal Bomber's armor was a yellow light alloy armored hull and its overall design was the same as the standard N-1 fighter, and the craft was also protected by a deflector shield. The NB-1S also featured a droid socket for an astromech droid. The pilot had access to communications systems. Although it was seldom used by the Naboo Royal Security Forces, its design combined deadly Nubian technology with the spaceframe design of Naboo, was heavily armored, and carried devastating energy bombs for air-to-ground combat. The standard proton torpedo launching system was removed and replaced by a newly designed Nubian ion bomb rack/launcher system. This system integrated directly into the existing torpedo rack housing with little modification. The craft also featured two laser cannons.",,,

The gunship was able to carry a large variety of ordnance ranging from concussion bombs to torpedoes and electromagnetic pulse missiles.",,,
sw_t20,SHIP,"The Umbaran starfighter, also known as the T-20 fighter, was a starfighter model developed by the Umbaran militia during the Clone Wars. The starfighters saw heavy action in a defense of Umbara against the Galactic Republic. The Umbaran starfighter appeared odd when compared to other starfighters of the galaxy in that it had no true cockpit to speak of, instead utilizing only a command chair surrounded by an energy shield. The chair itself was ray shielded. This command chair would detach from the main fuselage and rest on the ground when the ship was not in use. The ship was controlled through a holographic interface that would surround the pilot's hands and the pilot would use hand gestures to control the ship. This could result in very erratic flight patterns if the ship were to be piloted by those unfamiliar with the controls. The ship was armed with a single rapid-fire laser cannon that could easily bring down scores of enemy infantry or tanks. In addition the starfighter is also armed with two electromagnetic pulse missile launchers similar to those on the Umbaran hover tank.",,,

The Scimitar had a pair of folding wings around a round cockpit; a design which was used on T-class long-range personal cruisers like the Valcyn which were used by Sith Lords like Darth Bane during the New Sith Wars about a millennium earlier and would later resurface in the famous TIE Series of starfighters used primarily by the Galactic Empire. In front of the round cockpit (the whole forward-center section of the spacecraft) of the vehicle was a rare stygium crystal-powered cloaking device for creating an invisibility field. This enabled the ship to sneak through even the most advanced of security technologies and allowed its master to evade pursuit while on his missions. The Infiltrator was protected by six low-profile solar ionization cannons which could extend and fire several bursts in the blink of an eye. It was also equipped with an experimental high temperature X-C 2 ion drive array which would resurface in future Sienar designs while the ship's hyperdrive was an unmodified SSDS 11-A. It could also carry six passengers while its total capacity was 2.5 metric tons.",,,

However, the Naboo had no need for such a bomber, and the original prototype was stolen by the Feeorin pirate Nym, who later named it Havoc. Several other prototypes were produced with only minor improvements, but the price tag on the starfighter dissuaded a number of potential buyers from investing in it.",,,
sw_starviper_mk2,SHIP,"The StarViper Mk. II, also known as the StarViper M-2, was a modification of the earlier StarViper-class attack platform. The design had less firepower than its predecessor, trading its heavy laser cannons for lighter lasers and heavier shielding while also removing the original model's proton torpedo launchers and replacing them with ion cannons. However, the increased versatility offered by the ion cannons made the craft popular with pirate groups and other criminal forces, including the Zann Consortium.",,,
sw_m3a_scyk,SHIP,"The M3-A Scyk fighter was a light interceptor, the lightest of all the starfighter designs produced by its Mandalorian manufacturer, MandalMotors. It was named after the Scyk lizard of Tatooine. Although the Scyk barely provided more amenities to its pilot than a TIE/LN starfighter did, it had two strong points - it was cheap and its weapon mount was designed to handle nearly anything. Its standard equipment consisted of a weapon, an engine, a reactor, a capacitor and a weak shield generator. Its laser cannon could be easily swapped for an ion cannon, concussion missiles or a proton torpedo launcher. Large organizations used this versatility to create wings of starfighters with complementary weapon mixes, while individual pilots benefited by replacing or upgrading damaged weapons anywhere in the galaxy. Apart from that, it had very little room for modifications and additional equipment, and was not able to fit a booster or a flight computer in addition to its default equipment, which made its pilots rely on allied ships to plot a hyperspace jump.",,,
sw_m12l,SHIP,"The M12-L Kimogila heavy fighter was the heaviest in MandalMotors line of snubfighters. The M12 was used by the Hutt crime organizations to protect their 'interests' and were often crewed by mercenary pilots. This custom Hutt starfighter was long ranged and could serve multiple roles in space combat. Its numerous gun emplacements classified the ship as a heavy fighter, and its torpedo capabilities allowed it to function as a bomber in special circumstances. This flexibility made it quite popular among free mercenaries. Though it lacked the speed and maneuvering capabilities of its predecessors, its ability to cause wanton slaughter could outweigh these factors.",,,
sw_g1m4c,SHIP,"The G1-M4-C Dunelizard, also known as the Medium Hutt Fighter, was a starfighter of medium weight developed by the Hutts and produced by MandalMotors. It saw use during the Galactic Civil War. The style 2 also saw some limited use among Naboo's RSF forces, alongside Kimogila, KSE Firespray class and Z-95 fighters. The Dunelizard's namesake was the dune lizard creature. The Dunelizard fighter was based upon the M3-A Scyk fighter, retaining that vessel's wedge-shaped wings, though the later model included a number of advanced features. The Dunelizard added heavier payload and shields, but retained the swiftness and maneuverability that made the Scyk popular with Hutts and other criminal organizations including space pirates such as Erkon the Vile.",,,

The Ixiyen was designed to be a dominant force in the average fighter-on-fighter confrontation. It was also armed and protected well enough to be able to harry much larger ships. Although not used in large numbers by any governmental organizations, it was not for lack of quality or performance. The Ixiyen was a deadly opponent, capable of holding its own against most of its contemporaries in front-line combat craft. The Ixiyen's focus on starfighter combat made it a fine choice for pilots expecting to meet resistance in flight. As a result, the Ixiyen was used quite extensively in the time of the Galactic Civil War by mercenaries and agents of Black Sun, as well other independent groups.",,,

While designed as a multi-role fighter, the Kyr'galaar has a strong emphasis on space superiority, and is more than capable of going toe to toe with most of what the galaxy has to throw at it as far as other fighter craft are concerned, and performs admirably in the interceptor and light bomber roles, thanks to its high speed and the large amount of ordnance it carries. Like with the Jai'galaar, the Kyr'galaar had its first real trial by fire during the delaying action of the evacuation of Breshig, where they not only kept enemy fighters off the bombers but acted in the defense of their host carriers.",,,
sw_besuliik,SHIP,"The Bes'uliik was a cutting-edge starfighter created by MandalMotors after the Yuuzhan Vong War, the first prototypes of which entered service with the Mandalorians in 40 ABY, during the Second Galactic Civil War. A Bes'uliik was originally designed for a crew of three, or two with an increased weapons/fuel loadout, although the earliest production prototypes were flown by single pilots.[3] The fighter was designed to be versatile, capable of being everything from a planetary-attack bomber to a long-range ""hunter-killer"".",,,
sw_preybird,SHIP,"The SoroSuub Preybird-class starfighter was a model of heavy starfighter. It was a capable starfighter for both offensive and defensive purposes, with a heavy laser cannon on each wing, and fore and aft concussion missile launchers. It was perhaps best known for the fact that it never entered full production. The Preybird was also one of the first craft to utilize an automatic gun harmonization system. This helped compensate for the wide stance of the laser cannons and allowed pilots to more accurately fire upon targets. The Preybird was designed a few years before the Battle of Endor, intended primarily for sale as an escort fighter on the open market, rather than for use in Sullust's own defense forces. However, disputes over the weapons systems led to substantial cost overruns, and ultimately to the project's discontinuation: only a few production ships made it off the assembly lines. Most of these found their way into the hands of a pirate organization in the Outer Rim known as the Hurrim.",,,
sw_x4_gunship,SHIP,"The X4 Gunship was an assault gunship built by the Incom Corporation and employed by the Rebel Alliance in their fight against the Galactic Empire during the Galactic Civil War. It was heavily armed with two forward mounted guns, three dorsal mounted turrets and three mounted turrets on its ventral surface. It also carried the heavy shields and armor typical of gunships, along with the relatively slow speeds and maneuvering. ",,,
sw_flarestar,SHIP,"The Flarestar-class attack shuttle, also known as the Flarestar-class Weequay ship, or the Weequay saucer craft, was a small saucer-shaped shuttle used by the Weequay pirates of Florrum. The Flarestar-class attack shuttle could be launched from the Surronian cruiser-based Corona-class armed frigate and land on surfaces too small for the mothership. It was at least 1/11 the size of the carrier vessel. The saucer craft had a dual cockpit design, with transparisteel canopies on the dorsal surface of the saucer. On the ventral side, the vessel had two thrusters, two laser cannons, missile launchers and three boarding ramps.",,,
sw_lancer_pc,SHIP,"The Lancer-class pursuit craft was a patrol ship produced by MandalMotors at the behest of the Black Sun crime syndicate. Bounty hunter Asajj Ventress utilized the Lancer-class craft Banshee during the Clone Wars, while hunter Ketsu Onyo flew a Lancer-class vessel, the Shadow Caster, during the reign of the Galactic Empire. Blurring the line between civilian freighter and warship, the Lancer was more interdiction and patrol vessel than workaday cargo hauler. Created on special commission for Black Sun by MandalMotors, the Lancer was designed to chase down fleeing cargo vessels and outrun other patrol ships. ",,,
sw_komrk,SHIP,"The Kom'rk-class fighter/transport was a type of starfighter and troop transport used by the Mandalorian splinter faction known as Death Watch during the Clone Wars. The Kom'rk-class's wings alternated between an upright landing position when grounded, and a horizontal configuration while flying in the atmosphere or space. While in flight, the wings could also rotate around the vessel's main body, allowing for increased maneuverability. The Kom'rk-class fighter was equipped with twin, forward-facing laser cannons located at the nose of the main body.",,,
sw_tie_fo,SHIP,"The TIE/fo space superiority fighter, commonly known as the First Order TIE fighter, was a starfighter used by the First Order. A product of Sienar-Jaemus Fleet Systems, the TIE/fo carried the appearance of its predecessor, the TIE/ln space superiority starfighter, though it featured internal advancements that provided it with greater defensive capabilities. Advancements from the Empire's TIE/ln included on-board deflector shields that provided better protection and offensive capabilities, improved solar cells, and higher-capacity converters. These upgrades were a side effect of the First Order's change of mentality towards its pilots, seeing them as critical assets rather than cannon fodder. However, like its Imperial predecessor, the TIE/fo lacked a hyperdrive, making it dependent on carrier vessels for transport and limiting it to short range missions.",,,
sw_tie_sf,SHIP,"The TIE/sf space superiority fighter, also known as the Special Forces TIE fighter, was a starfighter model used by the First Order, a specialized version of the TIE/fo space superiority fighter. It was a two-seater unlike the previous TIE models and was outfitted with enhanced weapons and sensor systems as well as a hyperdrive and deflector shields. The TIE/sf was reserved for members of the First Order's elite Special Forces. A two-seat strike fighter used by the First Order's elite Special Forces pilots, the TIE/sf boasted weapons far more powerful than a standard TIE, combining laser cannons with a heavy weapons turret and a mag-pulse warhead launcher, giving the fighter a 360-degree field of fire and the ability to deliver special ordnance.",,,
sw_tie_se,SHIP,"The TIE/se Bomber, also known as the First Order TIE bomber, was a class of TIE line bomber using by the First Order during its war with the Resistance. The craft had two pods, similar to the old TIE bombers used by the Galactic Empire. The new version featured notched wings, like the original TIE Interceptor. The engine bank at the rear was squared off, creating a silhouette similar to the TIE silencer. The TIE variant had four solar collectors that also acted as its wings, with four laser cannons on each forward tip. The wings themselves were angled outwards, and it had two central pods, one with a cockpit.",,,
sw_tie_brute,SHIP,"The TIE/rb heavy starfighter was a variant of the TIE line starfighters used by the Galactic Empire, distinguished by its extra pod housing more powerful laser cannons. Unlike the regular TIE/LN starfighter, it was equipped with life support and a pressure controlled cockpit. As the fighter was theorized to be a larger target, the viewport was made of extra-reinforced transparisteel. The prototype was created by Sienar Fleet Systems in response to the Empire's expansion into the Outer Rim Territories. A designer at SFS led a team in trying to arm the standard TIE model with the heavier H-s9.3 cannons, which it could not handle. The weapons were then placed in an outrigger pod, becoming the basis for the TIE brute. Following the Galactic Civil War, the Imperial successor state known as the First Order used a similar model of fighter during their own war with the Resistance.",,,
sw_tie_invader,SHIP,"The TIE Invader Space Superiority Fighter was an advanced First Order TIE Fighter equipped with 4 L-s9.6 laser cannons, a ventral laser turret, missile launchers and deflector shield.",,,
sw_tie_dagger,SHIP,"The TIE/dg starfighter, also known as the TIE Dagger or the Sith TIE fighter, was a type of Sith-affiliated TIE line starship that was forged in secret by forces under the command of the reborn Darth Sidious, along with the Xyston-class Star Destroyer, the AAL-2100/9.5 atmospheric assault lander, and other new technology created by the Sith Eternal. The TIE/dg was part of the TIE line of ships that had previously served as the starfighter of choice for both the Galactic Empire and First Order. It had an armament of laser cannons beneath the ball cockpit, and two heavy laser cannons between the solar collector wing and the suspended winglet. These cannons gave it a deadly punch in starfighter combat. It was manufactured by Sienar-Jaemus Fleet Systems and had red designs representing their loyalty to the Sith. It had a cockpit, two triangular-shaped wings that featured solar collectors, and twin ion engines.",,,
sw_tie_es,SHIP,"The TIE/es assault shuttle, or TIE Echelon, was a transport of the TIE line used by the First Order. It possessed four heavy laser cannons as well as a dual light laser cannon turret, was capable of delivering 12 crew members plus additional cargo, had two clusters composed of three ion engines each (one for each side), as well as advanced sensors capable of monitoring and scanning enemy communications to allow them to avoid hostile encounters.",,,
sw_tie_silencer,SHIP,"The TIE/vn space superiority fighter, formally known as the TIE vendetta space superiority fighter and nicknamed the TIE silencer, was an angular variant of the TIE line starfighters used by the First Order. A product of Sienar-Jaemus Fleet Systems, its aggressive design and equally impressive firepower was specifically crafted for use among the most elite members of the First Order. As such, the fighter was engineered for speed and handling, though lesser pilots were still often overwhelmed and unable to maintain control of the nimble ship. As an advanced prototype starfighter, the TIE/vn incorporated the latest First Order military innovations, including experimental stealth gear meant to foil sensors and tracking. It featured a hyperdrive and a deflector shield generator and projector, and was powered by a starboard reactor. Working at hidden Sienar-Jaemus facilities, First Order designers reconfigured the weapons package of the TIE/sf to incorporate advances in power storage and energy conversion. For the TIE/vn, the TIE/sf's power cell spokes were replaced by a next-generation array protected beneath the hull, with shorter runs for trunk lines and converter coils. Rather than replicate the TIE/sf's ventral turret, the silencer relocated its missiles and heavy cannons to the wing apertures, giving the pilot superior targeting and a wider field of fire.",,,
sw_tie_baron,SHIP,"The TIE/ba Baron Space Superiority Interceptor was a model of TIE interceptor deployed by the First Order. One ship was used by Major Elrik Vonreg during the Cold War in his encounters with the New Republic and the Resistance. The TIE/ba Baron Space Superiority Interceptor was a class of interceptor that was manufactured by Sienar-Jaemus Fleet Systems for the First Order. The TIE Baron was equipped with a hyperdrive due to the First Order equipping its higher-end models with modern technology, and its all-crimson design suggested the pilot's skills far surpassed those of the Special Forces TIE pilots, who flew in ships adorned with a red stripe only. The twin ion engines were powered by two ion reactors with pre-charged deuterium power cells, which were capable of achieving an atmospheric speed of 1,250 kph. It was armed with four wingtip L-s9.7 laser cannons and projectile launchers capable of firing ST7 concussion missiles and mag-pulse warheads. It was well-protected with shielding and contained an ejector seat. The starfighter was equipped with a class 2 hyperdrive.",,,
sw_nsiss,SHIP,"The Nssis-class Clawcraft was a starfighter typically associated with the Chiss, but in fact was a hybrid development of standard Imperial technology. The fuselage was based on the ubiquitous ""ball cockpit"" of the TIE Series of Imperial starfighters, with a Sienar ion drive pod mounted on the rear, but stemming from the junction of cockpit and drive pod were two pairs of curving wings which thrust out like an X-wing's strike-foils, and then extended forward in a claw-like grip around the cockpit. At the tip of each wing was a Sienar L-s7.2 laser cannon. With modest deflector shields and thicker hull armor, Clawcraft were slower at sublight speeds than their TIE/LN starfighter progenitors, although the ion engines allowed the ship to achieve an atmospheric speed of 1,000 kilometers per hour, and a respectable sublight acceleration of almost forty thousand meters per second squared. Clawcraft made up for their lower sublight speed by greater maneuverability. Each curved wing could make minor position adjustments and was paired with a mounted control jet to allow a Clawcraft's pilot to throw the ship into sharp turns and complex maneuvers.",,,
sw_krsiss,SHIP,"The Krssis-class Interceptor was designed to fulfill an interceptor role lacking in the Chiss Expansionary Defense Force. Unlike the Nssis, this interceptor is both fast and deadly. While lacking the maneuverability of Nsiss, its combination of speed and power make it a deadly interceptor to Chiss Expansionary Defense Force.",,,

For an Empire of the Hand fighter, it is slow compared to other similar sized ships such as the Nssis-class Clawcraft, it was designed to slowly phase out the aging Syca-class Bomber. It is suited to engage any target but to should be kept out of dogfights.",,,
sw_yorik_et,SHIP,"The Yorik-et, referred to as a coralskipper or skip by New Republic forces, was the Yuuzhan Vong version of a starfighter during their invasion of the galaxy. Like all classes of Yuuzhan Vong spacecraft, the coralskipper utilized the dovin basal as a means of propulsion, which became a weakness to exploit when destroying the coralskipper.

The Yorik-vec was armed with the yaret-kors used on coralskippers and corvettes, though the cruiser introduced two variations on the design. The first, the Yorik-vec's chief weapon, was a turret-mounted version of the weapon appendage found on coralskippers, while the second consisted of twin Yaret-Kors. The Yorik-vec also used a dovin basal for propulsion and defense.",,,

sw_station_golan_ii,SHIP,"The Golan II Space Defense SpaceGun, also known simply as the Golan II, was the second space station in Golan Arms' series of space defense platforms. The Golan II was the successor to the original Golan platform, which was judged to be insufficiently powerful to counter the threat of larger ships such as Star Destroyers. Though the Golan II was based on the same general principles of design and function, the hull was built with a unique crossbeam structure to increase the station's durability, and more efficient power generators allowed for a significant increase in shield power. The Golan II station was armed with 35 turbolaser batteries, 10 proton torpedo launchers, and 8 tractor beam projectors. Like the Golan I, they also contained a hangar for small vessels, capable of launching at least 13 starfighters. Golan II platforms were used to defend more valuable targets, like the Imperial shipyards in the Bilbringi system. At the Battle of Bilbringi, it took the combined efforts of Rogue Squadron and two New Republic assault frigates to neutralize one Golan II.",,,
sw_station_golan_iii,SHIP,"The Golan III Space Defense NovaGun, also known simply as the Golan III, was the third space station in Golan Arms' series of space defense platforms.

Jabba hoped that Zann would destroy the droideka Mark IIs in a droid factory that had been constructed by Geonosians during the Clone Wars, though the Hutt was counting on Zann dying in the process, as the two were enemies. Jabba used data stored on the planet Saleucami, which Zann had recently captured, to tempt Zann with the prospect of building an army.

After the victory over Jabba's forces, Zann agreed to a ceasefire with the Hutts so long as they lifted the bounty on his head and ceased attacking his operations and he promised to avoid interfering in Hutt affairs. Upon their agreement, Hypori came under the control of the Zann Consoritum, and the criminal organization used the planet's technology to continue production of droideka Mark IIs, as well as to construct Crusader-class gunships and droid works and factories on their other worlds. These new droidekas soon began to appear in the hands of mercenary groups and private armies across the galaxy.",,,
planet_saleucami,CUSTOM,"Saleucami was a dim, arid world in the Suolriep sector of the Outer Rim Territories. An economic powerhouse and major trading center in the Outer Rim, Saleucami was politically powerful during the Great Galactic War and a strategically held world within the Confederacy of Independent Systems during the Clone Wars. Controlled by the Techno Union throughout the Separatist Crisis, the world was liberated by the Grand Army of the Republic before the rise of the Galactic Empire and was spared the retribution demanded of other former Separatist worlds. Located between Kegan and Handooine along the Talcene Transit, the planet was supplied by cargo ships off of the Perlemian Trade Route that were headed to the Kuthic Worlds. As the Republic transformed into the Galactic Empire, Saleucami's place within the galaxy remained unchanged. An Imperial Governor was installed in the region to ensure the planet's loyalty to Coruscant; though the governor came to be on the payroll of the Zann Consortium. During the Galactic Civil War, Jabba Desilijic Tiure had some holdings and a secret communications outpost on Saleucami, which were captured and eventually forcibly handed over to Tyber Zann shortly after the Battle of Yavin. Around the same time, the space above the planet was also the site of a skirmish between the Rebel forces of Renegade Squadron, led by Commander Gial Ackbar, and Imperial troops, led by the bounty hunter Boba Fett, which led to the capture of most of the Rebels on the mission.",,,
planet_mandalore,CUSTOM,"Mandalore was the fifth planet in the Mandalore system of the Outer Rim Territories, not far from the Hydian Way trade route. The homeworld of the multi-species cultural group known as the Mandalorians, the planet was known as Manda'yaim in the Mandalorian language, and was named after the legendary conqueror of the vibrant world, Mandalore the First. Mandalore the First's Taung warriors slew the indigenous mythosaurs and tamed the savage landscape, solidifying Mandalore's place as a powerbase and the center of Mandalorian space for millennia to come. Mandalore was covered in a rich natural landscape, largely unspoiled due to its sparse sentient population. The world was blanketed in lush veshok tree forests, dense jungle, sprawling hills and grassland well suited to farming, inhospitable deserts of white sand, and numerous rivers, lakes, and seas. It was also the only known world in the galaxy, with the exception of its moon Concordia, to possess the unique, nearly indestructible iron ore known as beskar, an element capable of withstanding blows from even a lightsaber.",,,
planet_basilisk,CUSTOM,"Basilisk was home to the Basiliskans, an intelligent lizard species. They were the creators of the Basilisk war droids, that were rumored to be modeled after themselves. During their war with the Mandalorians around the year 4017 BBY, the Basiliskans chemically poisoned their own planet, in a last effort to defeat their conquerors. Despite receiving Jedi and Republic reinforcements under Sidrona Diath at the Battle of Basilisk, the Mandalorians conquered the planet and enslaved the remaining Basiliskans. After the war, the Mandalorians found a new use for the Basiliskans. With their tough hides and claws, with which they could be trained, and their intelligence, the Mandalorians used them as weapons for aerial and ground fighting during later wars. Because of this the Basiliskans degenerated and became nothing more than beasts. As such, they were re-named the Lagartoz War Dragons.",,,
planet_concordDawn,CUSTOM,"Concord Dawn was an agricultural frontier world in the Mandalore sector of the Outer Rim Territories. The planet had strong ties to the Mandalorians; its population shared many Mandalorian values, and genetic markers specific to the natives of Concord Dawn were present throughout the Mandalorian populace. Concord Dawn was a flashpoint for the Mandalorian Civil War in 58 BBY, when the Death Watch of Tor Vizsla scattered the True Mandalorians of Mandalore Jaster Mereel, a native of Concord Dawn. Mereel escaped and turned the tables on Vizsla with the help of a native boy, Jango Fett, orphaned by the Death Watch. Jango's son Boba Fett would later settle on Concord Dawn before being exiled for the murder of his superior officer. Concord Dawn was an Outer Rim world in the Mandalore sector, located near the border between the Outer and Mid Rim. Like the rest of its sector, it was frontier country, covered in jungles, forests, deserts and plains. The planet was principally an agricultural world, backwards in development, and its plains were tilled by the planet's farmers to meager effect. The region of Concord Dawn around the Fett family homestead and its nearby village was arid and dusty, though still capable of growing crops.",,,
planet_ordMantell,CUSTOM,"Ord Mantell was a terrestrial planet which was located into the Bright Jewel system of the Bright Jewel sector in the Mid Rim Territories. It was located near Anobis and was originally settled by the Galactic Republic circa 12,000 BBY as an Ordnance/Regional Depot. The planet was primarily known as a former industrial world, where large portions of the planet's surface was covered in immense junkyard fields, which served as the perfect lawless haven for many smugglers, mercenaries and bounty hunters of all stripes. Although a dangerous place, its strategic location on the Celanon Spur between the Expansion Region and the Outer Rim Territories gradually made the planet as the leading commercial hub not only of the Bright Jewel sector, but of the Dohu sector and Qiilura sector as well. Before the start of the Clone Wars, Jedi Knight Pablo-Jill brought peace to the lawless world. Anakin Skywalker's fleet was ambushed by Separatist forces while making a supply run to the planet. Despite this, the overall lack of Republic presence on the world allowed for Black Sun to control the world and its criminal enterprises. The Shadow Collective seized this as an opportunity when the Clone Wars erupted across the galaxy, enveloping Black Sun and other criminals to amassing a large criminal empire. When the Confederacy of Independent Systems attempted to establish a stronghold on Ord Mantell, Darth Maul led the armies of the Shadow Collective against the droid army, and defeated both Count Dooku and General Grievous, before abandoning the world to the Republic.",,,
planet_mustafar,CUSTOM,"Mustafar was a small planet located in the Mustafar system of the Outer Rim Territories, coreward of Rutan, between the Hydian Way and the Ninth Quadrant. A fiery volcanic world where an unusual type of lava was mined as a natural resource, Mustafar often served as a place to dispose of unwanted evidence, a quality which drew Black Sun to the planet. It also drew the Sith: it was here that Darth Maul began his training under Darth Sidious. Mustafar served as the last capital of the Confederacy of Independent Systems during the Clone Wars, thus becoming the site of the Separatists' downfall, an event that shaped galactic history. In a duel that followed, Darth Vader fought his former mentor, Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi. The fallen Jedi lost and was severely burnt after he was caught on fire by one of Mustafar's lava rivers, forcing him to wear a suit of dark armor to live. At some point prior to the second year of the clone war, Black Sun, under the leadership of Xomit Grunseit, moved its headquarters to a fortress on Mustafar. Death Watch, together with their new allies Darth Maul and Savage Opress, arrived in the Black Sun complex with an offer of allegiance. When Grunseit refused, Opress murdered all the members of his cabal, making Captain of the Guard Ziton Moj leader of the syndicate.",,,
planet_scarif,CUSTOM,"Scarif was a remote, tropical planet in the Abrion sector of the Outer Rim Territories. Although a small and idyllic world, Scarif played an important part in the Galactic Empire's military-industrial complex, becoming a center for top-secret research beyond inspection distance of the prying eyes of the Imperial Senate.

The ecumenopolis was the homeworld of House Santhe and the headquarters of Santhe/Sienar Technologies. Located on the junction of the Perlemian Trade Route, the Cadinth Run and the Shaltin Tunnels, Lianna was one of the busiest ports in the Tion Cluster. Lianna was conquered by warlords from Tion in the planet's early history, though it later fell under the jurisdiction of the Kingdom of Barseg by the time of the Galactic Republic. At approximately 300 BBY, the Senate eventually decided to take control of Lianna from Barseg, though some two hundred years later, Sienar Technologies set up operations on Lianna, after the planet continued to be misused as an industrial center even after the Senate's intervention. Soon after, the company was taken over by Kerred Santhe, who moved his company's headquarters to Lianna. Following the Declaration of a New Order, Lianna became a supporter of the Galactic Empire until Emperor Palpatine's defeat at the Battle of Endor.",,,
planet_ilum,CUSTOM,"Ilum was a snow-covered planet located in the 7G sector of the Unknown Regions, within the Ilum system. Ilum was the fifth planet from its parent star Asar, a blue dwarf, located roughly equidistant from Asar and the system's cometary cloud. Ilum had a kyber crystalline core, and had been utilized by the Jedi Order for the Gathering, a rite of passage in which Jedi younglings had to find and harvest kyber crystals for their lightsabers, which had existed for thousands of standard years. After the fall of the Empire, its successor state, the First Order, converted the massive trench into Starkiller Base: a system-destroying superweapon that was the culmination of the Empire's research into dark energy translations and hyperspace tunneling. Held in secret by the First Order, its modifications allowed Ilum to act as a mobile base and major weapons platform until it was destroyed by the Resistance in desperation after Starkiller's destruction of the Hosnian system.",,,
planet_exegol,CUSTOM,"Exegol was a dark desert planet located within the Unknown Regions that, according to legend, was the hidden redoubt world of the Sith. It was occupied by the Sith Lord Darth Sidious and the Sith Eternal by 35 ABY. It was also the birthplace of Supreme Leader Snoke, whom Sidious created to rule the First Order while concealing himself in the shadows. Exegol was used to hide the Final Order, which was a fleet amassed by Sidious and the Sith Eternal, from where they planned to deploy their Star Destroyers and establish a new Sith Empire. Exegol was a dark, barren, and rocky planet with desert flats. Its dry conditions, combined with the rubbing of dust particles in its atmosphere, created enormous static discharges that appeared as lightning strikes from the planet, which made the atmosphere too dangerous to deploy deflector shields. The desolate world was covered with enormous fissures that reached deep into its crust. These were excavated by Sith loyalists who were attempting to reach a transportative vergence they believed to lie beneath the surface.",,,
planet_lothal,CUSTOM,"Lothal was a planet in the Outer Rim Territories. During the early years of the Galactic Empire, Lothal was in a state of economic disrepair and invited the Empire to take over the planet's industries, with the promise of prosperity and security. Although many people said the Empire would bring doom, the ones preaching new jobs and prosperity were vindicated. By 5 BBY, Lothal became the nesting ground for the Spectres, a small rebel cell which operated from the starship Ghost. After harrying Imperial forces and disrupting Imperial activities for at least a year, the Spectres eventually attracted the attention of Grand Moff Wilhuff Tarkin and Darth Vader, who tried unsuccessfully to stamp out these rebels. Vader even imposed a blockade on the planet, but the Spectres managed to slip through and rejoin the larger rebellion. By 35 ABY, Lothal was under the control of the First Order, the successor state to the Empire. Following the Battle of Exegol, Lothal was one of many systems that rebelled against the Order.",,,
