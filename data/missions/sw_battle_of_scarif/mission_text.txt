Location: Scarif
Date: 0 BBY

The Battle of Scarif, also known as the action on Scarif, the mission to Scarif, or the raid on Scarif, was the first major battle fought in 0 BBY between the Alliance to Restore the Republic and the Galactic Empire during the Galactic Civil War. 

Under the callsign Rogue One, the unit infiltrated Scarif's planetary shield in a stolen Zeta-class cargo shuttle and proceeded to wage a guerrilla assault on the Citadel's outskirts, drawing away Imperial forces so that Andor, Erso, and the droid K-2SO could infiltrate the facility. Director Orson Krennic, the former commander of the Death Star, attempted to stop Erso and Andor from stealing the plans, but the heavily outnumbered Rebels received support from the Alliance Fleet under Admiral Raddus, whose forces engaged the Imperial Star Destroyers above Scarif and worked to destroy the Shield Gate protecting the planet.
