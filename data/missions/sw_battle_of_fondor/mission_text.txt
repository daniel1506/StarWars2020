Location: Fondor
Date: 4 BBY

A battle took place between the Alliance to Restore the Republic and the Galactic Empire at Fondor Station within the Imperial shipyard over the world Fondor shortly after the Battle of Endor in 4 ABY. Right before the conflict erupted, Moff Raythe's Imperial II-class Star Destroyer Dauntless prepared to depart the shipyard with experimental satellites meant for Operation: Cinder in tow while the special commando unit Inferno Squad oversaw its protection, before a rebel fleet suddenly attacked Fondor Station. The MC80 Star Cruiser within the fleet disabled the Dauntless with its ion cannons, leaving the Star Destroyer defenseless.

To prevent the rebels from learning about the satellites' true purpose, Inferno Squad and several TIE fighters were deployed to engage the rebel ships. Inferno Squad defended the Dauntless from U-wings attempting to board the Star Destroyer. The leader of Inferno Squad, Commander Iden Versio, infiltrated the rebel Star Cruiser's weapons bay and disabled its ion cannons with the assistance of Agent Gideon Hask. Upon leaving the Star Cruiser, Versio continued to defend the Dauntless and freed it by the destroying the docking clamps holding the ship in place.
